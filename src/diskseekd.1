.SH DESCRIPTION
Several people have noticed that Linux has a bad tendency of killing
floppy drives. These failures remained completely mysterious, until
somebody noticed that they were due to huge layers of dust
accumulating in the floppy drives. This cannot happen under Messy Dos,
because this excuse for an operating system is so unstable that it
crashes roughly every 20 minutes (less when you are running
Windows). When rebooting, the BIOS seeks the drive, and by doing this,
it shakes the dust out of the drive mechanism.
.PP
.B diskseekd
simulates this effect by seeking the drive periodically.  If it is
called as
.BR diskseek ,
the drive is seeked only once.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " "drive"
Selects the drive to seek.  By default, drive 0
.RI ( /dev/fd0 )
is seeked.
.TP
.BI "-i " "interval"
Selects the cleaning interval, in
seconds.
If the interval is 0, a single
seek is done. This is useful when calling diskseek from a crontab.
The default is 1000 seconds (about 16 minutes) for
.B diskseekd
and 0 for
.BR diskseek .
.TP
.BI "-p " "pidfile"
Stores the process id of the diskseekd daemon into
.I pidfile
instead of the default
.IR /var/run/diskseekd.pid .
.SH BUGS
1. Other aspects of Messy Dos' flakiness are not simulated.
2. This manpage lacks a few smileys.
