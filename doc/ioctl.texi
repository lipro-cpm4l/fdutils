@cindex ioctl list
@cindex floppy ioctls

All these ioctl's may be issued using the floppycontrol program. (See
also floppycontrols man page)

@table @code
@item FDSETPRM
sets the geometry (number of tracks, heads and sectors,
etc) of a drive.
@item FDDEFPRM
sets the geometry in a permanent way (not cleared after a
disk change)
@item FDGETPRM
read a previously set drive geometry (or an autodetected
geometry) back.
@item FDCLRPRM
makes the driver forget the geometry for a given drive
(to trigger autodetection)
@item FDFLUSH
forgets the contents of the floppy buffers. CAUTION: This
doesn't write dirty buffers to the disk. Use fsync first.
@item FDGETDRVTYP
displays the type of a drive (name parameter). This is
used by @code{MAKEFLOPPIES}. For the naming convention, see the description
of the @code{MAKEFLOPPIES} script. For formats which work in several drive
types, @code{FDGETDRVTYP} return a name which is appropriate for the oldest
drive type which supports this format.
@item FDSETDRVPRM
sets various drive parameters.
@item FDGETDRVPRM
reads these parameters back.
@item FDGETDRVSTAT
gets the cached drive state (disk changed, write
protected et al.)
@item FDPOLLDRVSTAT
polls the drive and return its state.
@item FDGETFDCSTAT
gets the floppy controller state.
@item FDRESET
resets the floppy controller under certain conditions.
@item FDRAWCMD
sends a raw command to the floppy controller.
@item FDWERRORCLR
clear the write error stats.
@item FDWERRORGET
gets the write error stats.
@item FDSETMAXERRS
sets the error thresholds (when to display error messages on the
console, and when to abort operations). The maxerror structure is part
of the drive parameters, but this ioctl is needed in addition to
@code{FDSETDRVPRM} because @code{FDSETDRVPRM} is only accessible to the
superuser whereas @code{FDSETMAXERRS} is accessible to whoever has write access
to the floppy device.

@item FDMSGON/FDMSGOFF
switch informational messages on/off. This flag is part of the drive
parameters as well, but @code{FDMSGON/FDMSGOFF} don't need superuser status.

@end table

There are other ioctls as well, but they are considered obsolete and
their use is discouraged.
