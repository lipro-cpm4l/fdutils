@unnumbered Introduction

Fdutils is a collection of utililties for configuring and using the
Linux floppy driver.  With fdutils, you can:

@enumerate
@item
Format disks with a higher capacity than usual (up to 1992KB on a 3 1/2
HD disk).
@item
Reconfigure the autodetection sequence to automatically detect some of
these extended formats.
@item
Access various internal driver structures and drive configuration using
the floppycontrol program.
@end enumerate

This manual describes these utilities, and also the floppy driver
itself.
