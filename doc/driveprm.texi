@chapter Drive descriptions

Unlike earlyer version, fdutils-5.0 separates drive descriptions and
media description.  For more details on this separation,
@pxref{Media Introduction}.  Drive descriptions are used to describe the
hardware characteristics of a drive, such as their maximal density,
their rotation speed, their form factor, etc.

@section Syntax

A drive description is a series of @emph{variable=value} and
@emph{selector} clauses.

@menu
* Density               :: The maximal available density on the drive
* Form factor           :: Whether this drive is a 3 1/2", 5 1/4" or 8" drive
* Cmos code             :: Sums up both density and form factor
* Other parameters      :: Rotation speed and tracks per inch

@node Density, Form factor, Syntax of a drive description, Syntax of a drive description
@subsection Density

The density of a drive is the highest media density that it supports.
Density is one of @code{sd}, @code{dd}, @code{qd}, @code{hd} or
@code{ed}.  Usually, you do not need to specify this parameter, as it
can be derived from the drives CMOS code.


@node Form factor, Cmos code, Density, Syntax of a drive description
@subsection Form factor

The form factor of a drive describes the physical dimensions of the
media it accepts.  It is one of @code{3.5}, @code{5.25} or @code{8}.
Usually, you do not need to specify this parameter, as it can be derived
from the drives CMOS code.

@node Cmos code, Other parameters, Form factor, Syntax of a drive description
@subsection Cmos code

The PC Bios already knows on its own about the most common drive types.
These are named by an integer from 1 to 6, according to the following
table.
@example
0        no drive installed
1        5.25 DD
2        5.25 HD
3        3.5 DD
4        3.5 HD
5        3.5 ED
6        3.5 ED
@end example

As you see 3.5 ED drives have two possible codes.  Some BIOSes use 5,
others use 6.  The reason for this is that initially 5 was intended for
floppy tape drives, and only 6 was for 3.5 ED drives.  However, some
BIOS manufacturers didn't know about this convention, and used 5 for the
then "new" 3.5 ED drives.

Usually, you do not need to specify this parameter, as it can be read
from the physical CMOS of your PC.  This parameter may be useful if your
BIOS does not store the drive's CMOS code at the expected place, or if
you have more than two drives.

@node Other parameters, , Cmos code, Syntax of a drive description
@subsection Other parameters

@table @code
@item deviation=@var{deviation}
Tells how much more/less raw capacity the drive has than the standard.
Due to slightly different rotation speeds @footnote{drives do not always
rotate at exactly 5 or 6 rotations per second, but some may be slightly
faster or slightly slower than spec} and to slightly different data
transfer rates, the raw capacity per track can vary slightly.  For
normal formats, these small deviations from the prescribed raw capacity
is not harmful, as these have plenty of safety margins built in.
However, the new extra capacity formats are affected by this, as they
try to squeeze every available raw byte out of the disk.

Deviation is expressed in ppm.  Positive values mean a higher raw
capacity than normal, and negative values mean a lower raw capacity than
normal.  The deviation can be measured using the @code{floppymeter}
program.

@item rpm=@var{rotation_speed}

Prescribed rotation speed of the drive, expressed in rotations per
minute.  This is 360 for 5 1/4 HD drives, and 300 for all other commonly
available drive types.  Usually, you do not need to specify this
parameter, as it can be derived from the drive's CMOS code.  It is
useful however for single density drives or other drives not commonly
found on a PC.  Usually, you do not to specify this parameter, as it can
be derived from the drive's form factor and maximal density.

@item tpi=@var{cylinder_density}

This parameter is only meaningful for 5 1/4 drives.  It expresses
whether the drive is able to use 80 tracks (@code{tpi=96}) or only 40
(@code{tpi=48}).  Usually, you do not to specify this parameter, as it
can be derived from the drive's maximal density: quad density and high
density drives are 96 tpi, whereas double density drives are 48 tpi.

@node Drive definition file, , Syntax of a drive description, Drive descriptions
@section The drive definition file in @file{/usr/local/etc/fddriveprm}

@file{/usr/local/etc/fddriveprm} @footnote{The actual location of this
file depends on the value of the @code{sysconfdir} compile time
configuration variable (@pxref{Compile-time configuration} for details)}
contains a dictionary of commonly used media descriptions.  Each
description is identified by a name, which can then be used by setfdprm
or superformat to refer to it, instead of an explicit description.

Each definition starts with @code{"drive}@emph{number}@code{":},
followed by the actual description.  Definitions may be spread over
several lines, for better readability.  The file may contain comments,
which start with # and stop at the end of the line.
