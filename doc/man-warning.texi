@c for man page version only
@unnumbered Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following
commands:
@example
    ./configure; make dvi; dvips fdutils.dvi
@end example

@item
To generate a html copy,  run:
@example
    ./configure; make html
@end example
A premade html can be found at:
@file{http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils}

@item
To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:
@example
    ./configure; make info
@end example
@end itemize

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
