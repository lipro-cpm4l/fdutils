@pindex diskd

The diskd command has the following syntax:

@example
@code{diskd} [@code{-d} @var{drive}] [@code{-i} @var{msdosfiles}] [@code{-e} @var{command}]
@end example

Diskd waits for a disk to be inserted into a given @var{drive}, and then
either executes the @var{command} or exits. This program can be used to
automatically mount a disk as soon as it is inserted.

@subsection Warning

This program works by switching the motor on for a very short
interval, and then seeking to track -1. This might damage hardware in
the long run. Amigas, which also use these techniques, are known for
having problems with their disk drives no longer spinning up properly
after a few month of usage.

@subsection Options

@table @code
@item -d @var{drive}
Selects the drive to observe for disk insertion. By default, drive 0
(@code{/dev/fd0}) is observed.
@item -i @var{interval}
Selects the polling interval. The interval is given in tenths of
seconds. Default is 10 (one second).
@item -e @var{command}
Gives the command to be executed when a disk is inserted. If no
command is given the program simply exits. Typically, the command
mounts the disk. It can be a shell scripts which probes for several
filesystems and disk geometries until it succeeds.

@subsection Bugs


@itemize @bullet

@item
Automatic unmounting cannot yet be handled. It is indeed not enough to
scan for disk removal, because when the disk is removed, it is already
too late: There might be some buffers needing flushing.  However, the
@code{fdmountd} program allows automatic unmounting by using the
@code{SYNC} mount options, which switches off write buffering
(@pxref{fdmount}).

@item
The drive motor is running all the time, and on some computers, the
drive led flickers at each time the drive is polled.
