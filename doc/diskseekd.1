.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
.SH Description
.PP
Several people have noticed that Linux has a bad tendency of killing
floppy drives. These failures remained completely mysterious, until
somebody noticed that they were due to huge layers of dust accumulating
in the floppy drives. This cannot happen under Messy Dos, because this
excuse for an operating system is so unstable that it crashes roughly
every 20 minutes (actually less if you are running Windows).  When
rebooting, the BIOS seeks the drive, and by doing this, it shakes the
dust out of the drive mechanism. \fR\&\f(CWdiskseekd\fR simulates this effect
by seeking the drive periodically.  If it is called as \fR\&\f(CWdiskseek\fR,
the drive is sought only once.
.PP
.SH Options
.PP
The syntax for \fR\&\f(CWdiskseekd\fR is as follows:
 
.nf
.ft 3
.in +0.3i
\&\fR\&\f(CWdiskseekd [\fR\&\f(CW\-d \fIdrive\fR\&\f(CW] [\fR\&\f(CW\-i \fIinterval\fR\&\f(CW] [\fR\&\f(CW\-p \fIpidfile\fR\&\f(CW]
.fi
.in -0.3i
.ft R
 
\&\fR
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\-d\ \fIdrive\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Selects the drive to seek.  By default, drive 0 (\fR\&\f(CW\(if/dev/fd0\(is\fR) is sought.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\-i\ \fIinterval\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Selects the cleaning interval, in seconds.  If the interval is 0, a
single seek is done. This is useful when calling diskseek from a
crontab.  The default is 1000 seconds (about 16 minutes) for
\&\fR\&\f(CWdiskseekd\fR and 0 for \fR\&\f(CWdiskseek\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\-p\ \fIpidfile\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Stores the process id of the diskseekd daemon into \fIpidfile\fR instead
of the default \fR\&\f(CW\(if/var/run/diskseekd.pid\(is\fR.
.PP
.SH Bugs
.TP
1.\ 
Other aspects of Messy Dos' flakiness are not simulated.
.TP
2.\ 
This section lacks a few smileys.
