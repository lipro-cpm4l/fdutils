.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWfdmount\fR program mounts a floppy disk in the specified
drive. It tries to figure out the exact format and filesystem type of
the disk from data in the disk's boot sector or super block and the
auto-detected track layout.
.PP
Currently, fdmount supports the filesystems \fR\&\f(CWminix\fR, \fR\&\f(CWext\fR,
\&\fR\&\f(CWext2\fR, \fR\&\f(CWxia\fR, and \fR\&\f(CWmsdos\fR, and includes special support
for disks formatted by the \fR\&\f(CW2M\fR utility for MS-DOS.
.PP
It also checks whether the disk is write protected, in which case 
it is mounted read-only.
.PP
The symbolic \fIdrivename\fR is (currently) one of \fR\&\f(CW\(iffd[0-7]\(is\fR,
corresponding to the special device files \fR\&\f(CW\(if/dev/fd[0-7]\(is\fR. If
\&\fIdrivename\fR is not specified, \fR\&\f(CW\(iffd0\(is\fR is assumed.
.PP
The disk is mounted on the directory \fImountpoint\fR, if specified, or
on \fR\&\f(CW\(if/fd[0-7]\(is\fR.  In either case, the mount point must be an
existing, writable directory.
.PP
\&\fBDue to a bug in the floppy driver (?), the polling interval (\-i
flag) must be longer than the spindown offset. Thus you need to do (for
example) floppycontrol \-\-spindown 99 before starting fdmountd in daemon
mode\fR

.SH Security
.PP
When mounting on the default mount point, the mount points' owner is set
to the current user, and the access flags according to the user's umask.
For a specified mountpoint, owner and permissions are left
unchanged. Default mount points are called \fR\&\f(CW/fd0\fR, \fR\&\f(CW/fd1\fR,
\&\&... , \fR\&\f(CW/fd7\fR.
.PP
The user running fdmount must have read access to the floppy device for
read only mounts, and read/write access for read/write mounts.
.PP
Fdmount can be run suid root, allowing users to mount floppy
disks. The following restrictions are placed upon non-root
users:
.TP
* \ \ 
If a mountpoint is specified explicitly, it must be owned by the user.
.TP
* \ \ 
A user may only unmount a disk if the mount point is owned by the user,
or if it the disk has been mounted by the same user.
.TP
* \ \ 
Non-msdos disks are automatically mounted with the \fR\&\f(CWnodev\fR and
\&\fR\&\f(CWnosuid\fR flags set.
.PP
However, \fBdo not rely on fdmount being secure at the moment\fR.
.PP
.SH Daemon\ mode
.PP
In daemon mode, the specified drive is periodically checked and if a
disk is inserted, it is automatically mounted.
.PP
When the disk is removed, it is automatically unmounted.  However, it is
recommended to unmount the disk manually \fIbefore\fR removing it. In
order to limit corruption, disks are mounted with the SYNC option when
running in daemon mode, unless the \fR\&\f(CW\-\-nosync\fR flag is given.
.PP
Note that this mode has some potential drawbacks:
.TP
* \ \ 
Some floppy drives have to move the drive head physically in order to
reset the disk change signal. It is strongly recommended not to use
daemon mode with these drives.  See section floppycontrol, for details.
.TP
* \ \ 
If a disk does not contain a filesystem (e.g. a tar archive),
the mount attempt may slow down initial access.
.TP
* \ \ 
As fdmount cannot identify the user trying to use the disk drive,
there is no way to protect privacy. Disks are always mounted with
public access permissions set.

\&\fR\&\f(CWerror\ reading\ boot/super\ block\fR\ 
fdmount failed to read the first 1K of the disk. The disk might be
damaged, unformatted, or it may have a format which is unsupported by the
FDC or the Linux kernel.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWunknown\ filesystem\ type\fR\ 
No magic number of any of the supported filesystems (see above) 
could be identified.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWsorry,\ can\(fmt\ figure\ out\ format\ (\fIfs\fR\&\f(CW\ filesystem)\fR\ 
The size of the filesystem on the disk is incompatible with
the track layout detected by the kernel and an integer number of
tracks. This may occur if the filesystem uses only part of the
disk, or the track layout was detected incorrectly by the kernel.

.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWcannot\ create\ lock\ file\ /etc/mtab~\fR\ 
If \fR\&\f(CW\(if/etc/mtab~\(is\fR exists, you should probably delete it. Otherwise,
check permissions.
.TP

Most probably, the default or specified mount point does not exist.
Use mkdir.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\fImountpoint\fR\&\f(CW\ is\ not\ a\ directory\fR\ 
The mountpoint is not a directory.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWnot\ owner\ of\ \fImountpoint\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Non-root users must own the directory specified as mount point.
(This does not apply for the default mount points, /fd[0-3].)
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWNo\ write\ permission\ to\ \fImountpoint\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Non-root users must have write permission on the mount point
directory.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWNot\ owner\ of\ mounted\ directory:\ UID=\fIuid\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Non-root users cannot unmount if the mount point is owned
(i.e. the disk was mounted) by another user.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWinvalid\ drive\ name\fR\ 
Valid drive names are \fR\&\f(CW\(iffd0\(is\fR, \fR\&\f(CW\(iffd1\(is\fR, etc.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWdrive\ \fIname\fR\&\f(CW\ does\ not\ exist\fR\ 
The drive does not exist physically, is unknown to the Linux kernel, or
is an unknown type.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWDrive\ \fIname\fR\&\f(CW\ is\ mounted\ already\fR\ 
Trying to mount a drive which appears to be mounted already.  Use the
\&\fR\&\f(CW\-\-force\fR option if you think this is wrong.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWDrive\ \fIname\fR\&\f(CW\ is\ not\ mounted\fR\ 
Trying to unmount a drive which does not appear to be mounted.  Use the
\&\fR\&\f(CW\-\-force\fR option if you think this is wrong.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWioctl(...)\ failed\fR\ 
If this occurs with the \fR\&\f(CWFDGETDRVTYP\fR or \fR\&\f(CWFDGETDRVSTAT\fR,
ioctl's you should probably update your Linux kernel.

.SH Bugs
.TP
* \ \ 
Fdmount should be more flexible about drive names and default
mount points (currently hard coded).
.TP
* \ \ 
Probably not very secure yet (when running suid root).
Untested with ext and xia filesystems.
.TP
* \ \ 
Can't specify filesystem type and disk layout explicitly.
.TP
* \ \ 
In daemon mode, the drive light stays on all the time.
.TP
* \ \ 
Some newer filesystem types, such as vfat are not yet supported.
