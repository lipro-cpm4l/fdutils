.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

\&\fR\&\f(CWXdfcopy\fR is a utility to copy and format XDF disks. XDF (eXtended
Density Format) is a format used by OS/2 which can hold 1840KB of data
(on a 3 1/2 high density disk). Its advantage over 2m formats is that it
is faster: 38KB/s. Because of this fast speed, I extended the XDF
standard to higher capacities (1992KB) with a transfer rate of 45KB/s. I
called the new formats XXDF.
.PP
This program works best with kernels newer than 2.0.0.
.PP
If both source and target are given, xdfcopy copies the disk image from
file to floppy disk or vice-versa. When copying to a floppy disk, the
disk is first formatted, unless the \fR\&\f(CW-n\fR option is given.
.PP
If no source is given, the target is only formatted. In this case, the
target must be a floppy drive.

.PP
Formats are selected by the format_id. The following formats are understood:
.IP
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW0\fR\ 
Formats a 5 1/4 XDF disk (1520 KB, 45.6 KB/s).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW1\fR\ 
Formats a 3 1/2 high density XDF disk (1840 KB, 38.3 KB/s).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW2\fR\ 
Formats a 3 1/2 extra density XDF disk (3680 KB, 102 KB/s)
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW3\fR\ 
Formats a 3 1/2 high density XXDF disk (1920 KB, 45 KB/s)
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW4\fR\ 
Formats a 3 1/2 extra density XXDF disk (3840 KB, 90 KB/s) 
.PP
.SH Misc\ options
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW-D\ \fIdosdrive\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Describes the DOS drive letter for mformat. If this option is given, an
MS-DOS filesystem is automatically installed on the disk after the
low-level format is complete. In order for this to work, the drive has
to be configured to accept the 23x2x80 geometry in your /etc/mtools or
your ~/.mtoolsrc file. Moreover, this only works with a version of
mtools that is more recent than 3.0.

\&\fR\&\f(CW-n\fR\ 
Don't format the disk before copying the disk image to the disk.
.PP
.SH Options\ for\ power\ users
.IP
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW-t\ \fIcylinder\ skew\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Uses a different track skew than the default (14). For more details on
skews, see section  superformat. In this version of xdfcopy, the \fR\&\f(CW-t\fR
parameter is ignored.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW-h\ \fIhead\ skew\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Uses a different head skew than the default (0) In this version, this
parameter is ignored
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW-d\fR\ 
Debugging. For each read or write operation, the time it took to
complete the operation is printed (in milliseconds). This can be used
to optimize the skews.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW-T\ \fIend-cylinders\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Tells how many cylinders to format.  With the XXDF formats, it is
actually possible to format up to 83 cylinders, yielding a format of
up to 1992KB on a 3 1/2 high density disk.
