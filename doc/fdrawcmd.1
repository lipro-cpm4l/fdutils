.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the

\&\fR
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWfdrawcmd\fR
is used to send raw commands to the floppy disk controller, after
having selected a given drive. You must have write permission to the
selected drive.
.PP
When writing to a disk, data is read from stdin; when reading, data
is printed to stdout.  Diagnostic messages, return values from the
controller, and the value of the disk change line after the command are
printed to stderr.
.PP
.SH Options
.PP
All numbers may be given in octal (0211), decimal (137), or hexadecimal
(0x89).
.IP
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWdrive=\fIdrive\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Selects the drive.  The default is drive 0 (\fR\&\f(CW\(if/dev/fd0\(is\fR).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWrate=\fIrate\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Selects the data transfer rate. Use 0 for high density disks, 1 for
double density 5 1/4 disks (or 2 Mbps tapes, if the appropriate rate
table is selected), and 2 for double density 3 1/2 disks.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWlength=\fIlength\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Describes the length of the transferred data for commands reading from
and writing to the disk.  The default is to continue until end of file.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWrepeat=\fIcount\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Repeat the command \fIcount\fR times.  This only works correctly for
commands which don't do any data transfer.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWcylinder=\fIcount\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Seek to the given cylinder before executing the command
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\fIcommand\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
The name of the command to send.  \fIcommand\fR may be a spelled out
name (like \fR\&\f(CWread\fR or \fR\&\f(CWwrite\fR), or a number representing the
commands floppy disk controller opcode.  A named command has already a
mode associated with it, whereas for a number the mode parameter should
be described using the \fR\&\f(CWmode\fR option.
.IP
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\fIparameters\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
The parameters for the command (optional, not all commands need
parameters).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW\fImode\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Various flags or'ed together describing the properties of the command.

Look for the chapter \fR\&\f(CWCOMMAND SET/DESCRIPTIONS\fR.  Older FDCs only
support a subset of the commands described therein, but the syntax for
the commands that do exist is the same.

\&\fR\&\f(CWread\ \fIdrvsel\ cyl\ head\ sect\ szcod\ spt\ rw-gap\ szcod2\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Reads \fIlength\fR bytes of data from the disk.  \fIdrvsel\fR is the
drive selector. Bit 0 and 1 describe the drive, and bit 2 describes the
head.  The remaining parameters give the cylinder, head (yes, again),
sector, size of the sector (128 * 2 ^ \fIszcod\fR), sectors per track
(\fR\&\f(CWspt\fR, this is used to switch to the second head when the first
side has been read), and size of the read-write gap. \fIszcod2\fR should
be 0xff.  \fR\&\f(CWread\fR returns \fIST0 ST1 ST2\fR and \fIcyl head sect
szcod\fR of the next sector to be read; see
\&\fR\&\f(CW\(if/usr/include/linux/fdreg.h\(is\fR .
.IP
N.B. Certain newer floppy disk controllers are buggy, and do not
correctly recognize the end of transfer when operating in virtual DMA
mode.  For these, you need to set \fR\&\f(CWspt\fR to the id of the last
sector to be read (for example, if you intend to read sectors 2, 3, 4,
set \fR\&\f(CWspt\fR to 4, even if the disk has more sectors), and set the
\&\fR\&\f(CWno-mt\fR flag.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWwrite\ \fIdrvsel\ cyl\ head\ sect\ szcod\ spt\ rw-gap\ szcod2\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Analogous to
\&\fR\&\f(CWread\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWsense\ \fIdrvsel\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Returns the third status byte (\fIST3\fR)
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWrecalibrate\ \fIdrvsel\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Recalibrates the drive and returns \fIST0 ST1\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWseek\ \fIdrvsel\ cyl\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Moves the head to \fIcyl\fR and returns \fIST0 ST1\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWspecify\ \fIdrvsel\ spec1\ spec2\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Specify various parameters to the drive.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWformat\ \fIdrvsel\ szcod\ sect-per-track\ fmt-gap\ fmt-fill\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Formats the cylinder. The new sectors are filled with \fIfmt-fill\fR.
The header information comes from the input, which is made up of
\&\fIcyl head sect szcod\fR quadruples. The \fIszcod\fR parameter
from the command line is used to describe the actual size of the
sectors, and the \fIszcod\fR from the input is used to write into the
header. However, the first write to these sectors will use the header
information, and might overwrite the following sectors if the
\&\fIszcod\fR parameter from the command line was too small.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWreadid\ \fIdrvsel\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
reads the first sector header that comes and returns 
\&\fIST0 ST1 ST2 \fR
and 
\&\fIcyl head sect szcod \fR
of the encountered header.

Unlock the FIFO configuration
.PP
.SS Commands\ available\ on\ 82078
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWpartid\fR\ 
echoes a byte describing the type of the FDC in the 3 high bits, and
the stepping in the three low bits.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWpowerdown\ \fIpowerconf\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
configures automatic power down of the FDC. The old configuration is echoed
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWoption\ \fIiso\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
enables/disables ISO formats. Odd values of
\&\fIiso\fR
enable these formats, whereas even values disable them. ISO formats
don't have index headers, and thus allow one to fit slightly more data on
a disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWsave\fR\ 
prints out 16 internal registers of the FDC.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWrestore\ \fIr1\ r2\ r3\ ...\ r16\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
restores the 16 internal registers of the FDC.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWformat_n_write\ \fIdrvsel\ szcod\ sect-per-track\ fmt-gap\ fmt-fill\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
formats the cylinder and writes initial data to it. The input data is
made up of a sequence of headers (4 bytes) and data:
\&\fIheader1 data1 header2 data2 ... headern datan\fR
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWdrivespec\ \fIdspec1\ dspec2\ ...\ specn\ terminator\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
chooses rate tables for various drives. Each dspec byte describes one
drive. Bits 0 and 1 say which drive is described. Bits 2 and 3 describe
the rate table. Only tables 0 and 2 are interesting. Both tables only
differ in the meaning of rate 1. For table 0 (the default) rate 0 is 300
kb/s (used for 5 1/4 DD disks), whereas for table 1 it is 2 Mbps (used
for fast floppy tape drives). Bit 4 is the precompensation table select
bit. It should be set to 0. Bit 5-7 should be zero as well. The
\&\fIterminator\fR byte ends the \fR\&\f(CWdrivespec\fR command. It is either
0xc0 or 0x80. If it is 0xc0, no result phase follows; if it is 0x80, the
current data rate table configuration for the four drives is echoed.
.PP
.SH Modes
The mode option is only needed when you describe the command as a
numerical value. Some mode names are also valid command names. They
are considered as command name if the command name has not yet been
given, and as mode name otherwise.
.PP
 If you give a command name followed by explicit modes, both the
implicit flags of the command name, and the explicit modes are or'ed
together.
.PP
 If on the other hand you give a command name preceded by explicit
modes, only the explicit modes are or'ed together.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWread\fR\ 
Read data from disk using DMA.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWwrite\fR\ 
Write data to the disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWintr\fR\ 
Wait for an interrupt.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWspin\fR\ 
wait for the disk to spin up
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWdisk\fR\ 
Aborts the operation if no disk is in the drive. This only works if you
also chose a physical cylinder to seek to.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWno-motor\fR\ 
Don't switch on the drive motor while issuing the command
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWno-motor-after\fR\ 
Switch off the motor immediately after the command returns.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWfm\fR\ 
Uses the FM version of the \fR\&\f(CWread\fR, \fR\&\f(CWreadid\fR, \fR\&\f(CWwrite\fR and
\&\fR\&\f(CWformat\fR commands.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWno-mt\fR\ 
Do not use MT (multitrack) mode for the \fR\&\f(CWread\fR, \fR\&\f(CWreadid\fR and
\&\fR\&\f(CWwrite\fR commands. This is needed on certain broken FDC's which
don't recognize end of transfer when running in \fR\&\f(CWnodma\fR mode. In
order to use these safely, set \fR\&\f(CWno-mt\fR, and chose the id of the
last sector to be read as \fR\&\f(CWsect-per-track\fR.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWfdrawcmd\fR opens the device node with the \fR\&\f(CWNDELAY\fR flag. This
means that the driver should not try to autodetect the disk type (it
might not be formatted), and that it should not reset the FDC. If a
reset was needed, the command simply fails. If that happens, execute
\&\fR\&\f(CWfloppycontrol \-\-resetnow 0\fR , and try again.
